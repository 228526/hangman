The goal of this project is to learn and implement the best practices,
in writing and maintaining a Python project. For this purpose, we use
a simple Gallows game program, from the book `"Invent Your Own
Computer Games with Python" <http://inventwithpython.com/chapters/>`_.

Usage
-----

After cloning the repository, you can run the game using the following
command.::

  $ python3 gallows.py

You execute the tests, using the following command.::

  $ python3 -m unittest discover

For Python versions less than 3.3, the mock module needs to be
installed to run the tests.
